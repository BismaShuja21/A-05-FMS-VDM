HEV Radiator Controller System
Background: A critical vehicle where a well-designed and effective radiator system is essential is a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). In these vehicles, the thermal management system, which includes the radiator, is crucial for maintaining optimal operating temperatures for various components, especially the electric drivetrain components and the battery. To control the radiator system effectively, a software solution is required. The radiator system is equipped with a temperature sensor and a fan that can be activated or deactivated based on predefined temperature thresholds.
